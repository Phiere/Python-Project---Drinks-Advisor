95,95,,"This is a smooth, soft wine that is full of black fruits and ripe tannins. The Merlot rounds out the rougher edges of the Malbec to give a rich juicy wine that will develop quickly. It is all fruit, generous and ready to drink from 2017.",Château Beauvillain-Monpezat,,14.0,,Malbec-Merlot,Rigal,
96,96,,"This is an easygoing wine that's neither too oaky nor too crisp, with a decent blend of ripe pear and baking spice flavors paired with soft, smooth texture.",,,,,,The Naked Grape,

98,98,,"Closer to Bordeaux than is Cahors, this is Malbec with a cooler visage. It has spice and stalky tannins along with plenty of acidity. The wine is bright with red berry fruits and a crisp lightly mineral aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",Pigmentum,,,,Merlot-Malbec,Georges Vigouroux,Buzet
99,99,,"This is a blend of 60% Ugni Blanc and 40% Colombard that gives a deliciously light and refreshing wine. Bright and breezy, it is perfumed, herbal and full of direct citrus flavors. Drink now.",,,,,Ugni Blanc-Colombard,,Côtes de Gascogne
