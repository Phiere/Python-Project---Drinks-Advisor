98,,"Closer to Bordeaux than is Cahors, this is Malbec with a cooler visage. It has spice and stalky tannins along with plenty of acidity. The wine is bright with red berry fruits and a crisp lightly mineral aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",Pigmentum,,,,Merlot-Malbec,Georges Vigouroux,Buzet
99,,"This is a blend of 60% Ugni Blanc and 40% Colombard that gives a deliciously light and refreshing wine. Bright and breezy, it is perfumed, herbal and full of direct citrus flavors. Drink now.",,,,,Ugni Blanc-Colombard,,Côtes de Gascogne
